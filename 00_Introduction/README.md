## Overview

Before embarking on your Vibe Coding journey, you need to complete the development environment setup. This step may seem simple, but it's the root cause of many issues students encounter later.

**Why Git Matters for AI Programming?**

</div>

The core toolchain of Vibe Coding—Cursor, GitHub, and AI model services—all depend on stable international network connections. Without Git:
- ❌ Cannot submit code
- ❌ Cannot pull repositories  
- ❌ Agent features blocked
- ❌ Authorization failures

With Git, you unlock the complete engineering workflow: collaborative development, change tracking, and deployment.

</div>

- **Git** (Local) - Distributed version control, local repository, offline work
- **GitHub** (Remote) - Centralized hosting, team collaboration, social coding
- **Push** - Upload code to GitHub
- **Pull/Clone** - Download code from GitHub

</div>

The setup flow covers:
1. **Git's Role & Value** - Why it's essential
2. **Installation** - Windows / macOS / Linux
3. **Initial Configuration** - Username, email, default branch, Credential Manager

---

## Configuration & Verification

</div>

Three key steps:
1. **Identity Set** - Configure global user.name and user.email
2. **Credentials Linked** - Set up Credential Manager and GitHub Token
3. **Integration Verified** - Test commit and push in Cursor
